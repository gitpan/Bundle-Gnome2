=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module bundles together all the Perl libraries available for
developing applications using the 2.x series of Gtk+ and Gnome. As well
as the core toolkit libraries there are also extra widgets (like
Gtk2::PodViewer) and bindings for libraries including gtkspell and
libwnck.

=head1 IMPORTANT NOTE

Almost all the modules in this bundle are wrappers around C libraries -
naturally, you will have to have those libraries (and their development
headers) installed I<before> you try to install this bundle.
